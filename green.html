                    <p class="review2">thoughts: i honestly think this album has shifted the timeline. it unironically defined a whole generation, full of creativity and individual identity, breaking every rule possible and never caring about what works.</p>

                    <p class="review2">recommended if you like: furries, bdsm, conspiracy theories, fedoras, those gangster cartoon shirts, the term "brOTP", mlg, raiding discord servers</p>
                    <p class="review2">thoughts: i love how it's the most extremely stereotypical male caricatures that are becoming more frequent and unironic. this tells a whole story, watching someone's joker moment, both hilarious and downright scary. still fresh and eye-opening to this day, i think dorian was trying to tell us something</p>

                    <p class="review2">released: march 25, 2021</p>

                    <p class="review2">thoughts: the most youthful album out there, watching myself and a friend grow up, all throughout the course of a summer, maybe our last year in town. it's messy like any other teenager heading onto adulthood, and it doesn't help over the fact that i listened to this album throughout my whole summer leading up to my freshmen year in college. </p>
